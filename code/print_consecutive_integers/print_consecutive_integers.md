https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-print/problem?isFullScreen=true
## Problem Statement

The included code stub reads an integer **n** from standard input (STDIN).

Without using any **string methods**, print the following:


where the numbers are **consecutive integers from 1 to n**, printed **without spaces**.

> Note: `"..."` represents the consecutive values in between.

## Task

Given an integer **n**, print the sequence of numbers from **1 through n** as a single string.

---

## Input Format

- The first line contains a single integer **n**

---

## Output Format

- Print the list of integers from **1 to n** as a continuous string, without spaces

---

## Constraints

- n is a positive integer

---

## Example

### Sample Input

### Sample Output
